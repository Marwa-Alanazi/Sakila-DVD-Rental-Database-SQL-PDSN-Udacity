## Introduction

This is the first project in Udacity Programming for Data Science which we study how to use SQL in data science.

---

## Project Overview

In this project, we use SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. We write SQL code to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database. As part of this project submission, we run SQL queries and build visualizations to showcase the output of your queries.

---

## Project Details

We query the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. We query the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance. 

### Requirements

* Have a question of interest.
* Have a supporting SQL query needed to answer the question.
* Have a supporting visualization created using the final data of your SQL query that answers your question of interest.
